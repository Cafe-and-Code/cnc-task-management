## Project Structure

All architecture documents are organized in the `architecture/` folder:

```
architecture/
├── ARCHITECTURE.md          # System architecture overview
├── DATABASE_SCHEMA.md       # Database design and relationships
├── API_SPECIFICATION.md     # RESTful API documentation
├── FRONTEND_SPECIFICATION.md # React frontend design
├── FILE_ARCHITECTURE.md     # Complete file structure
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md      # Deployment instructions
```

## Conclusion

The architecture phase has been completed successfully, providing a comprehensive foundation for the CNC Task Management System. The architecture is designed to be:

- **Scalable**: Can handle growing user bases and data volumes
