## Notes

- Each phase should be completed before moving to the next phase
- Regular code reviews and testing should be performed throughout
- Architecture documents should be referenced during implementation
- Any changes to the architecture should be documented and approved

## Current Status

Architecture phase has been completed successfully. Ready to begin Phase 1: Core Infrastructure implementation.
