# Proposal: Fix Project Page Empty State

## Problem
When a user has only one project, the project page displays nothing. This confuses users and makes it unclear whether their project exists.

## Objective
Ensure the project page always displays the user's project(s), even if there is only one. If there are no projects, show a clear empty state message.

## Scope
- Update the project page component to handle single project and empty states.
- Add an empty state message if no projects exist.
- Test with 0, 1, and multiple projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The project page displays the user's project(s) when at least one exists.
- The project page shows a clear empty state message if there are no projects.
- No blank screens or confusing UI states.
