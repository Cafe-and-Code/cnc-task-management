## Why

The CNC Task Management System has a complete .NET 8 backend with comprehensive APIs, but lacks a functional frontend to interact with the backend services. The current frontend structure exists but needs full implementation to provide users with a modern, responsive interface for managing projects, sprints, tasks, and teams using Scrum methodology.

## What Changes

- **Core Frontend Infrastructure**: Set up React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI components, and state management
- **Authentication System**: Implement login, registration, email verification, and profile management with JWT token handling
- **Dashboard**: Create comprehensive project dashboard with metrics, activity feeds, and quick actions
- **Project Management**: Build project CRUD operations, project settings, and team assignment interfaces
- **Sprint Management**: Implement sprint planning, execution, burndown charts, and sprint retrospectives
- **Product Backlog**: Create user story management with drag-and-drop prioritization and story point estimation
- **Kanban Board**: Build interactive task board with drag-and-drop, WIP limits, and real-time updates
- **Team Management**: Develop team creation, member management, and role assignment interfaces
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Implement charts for velocity, burndown, cumulative flow, and team performance metrics
- **Real-time Features**: Integrate SignalR for live updates, notifications, and collaboration
- **Admin Interface**: Build admin dashboard for user management and organization settings
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all interfaces work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
