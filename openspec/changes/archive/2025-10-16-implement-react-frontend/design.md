## Context

The CNC Task Management System requires a modern, responsive frontend to interact with its comprehensive .NET 8 backend API. The frontend must support multi-tenant Scrum project management with real-time collaboration, complex workflows, and data visualization capabilities. The system needs to serve various user roles (Admin, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, Stakeholder) with different permissions and interfaces.

### Key Stakeholders
- Development teams using the system for daily Scrum workflows
- Project managers overseeing multiple projects
- Administrators managing organizations and users
- Stakeholders viewing project progress and reports

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing .NET 8 backend APIs
- Support real-time features via SignalR
- Handle complex state management for multi-project scenarios
- Provide responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Implement robust authentication and authorization
- Support file uploads and attachments
- Handle large datasets with pagination and virtualization

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- **Modern Development Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **Excellent User Experience**: Intuitive, responsive, accessible interface
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates, notifications, and simultaneous editing
- **Performance**: Fast loading, smooth interactions, efficient data handling
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple organizations, projects, and concurrent users
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture, comprehensive testing, good documentation
- **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality available without internet connection

### Non-Goals
- Native mobile app development (focus on responsive web)
- Advanced video conferencing integration
- Complex workflow automation engines
- Multi-language internationalization (English only initially)
- Advanced AI-powered features

## Decisions

### Architecture Decision: Component-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Adopt feature-based component organization with shared UI components
**Rationale**:
- Improves code reusability and maintainability
- Enables team scaling with clear ownership boundaries
- Supports consistent design system implementation
- Facilitates testing and debugging

**Alternatives considered**:
- Page-based architecture (rejected for poor reusability)
- Layer-based architecture (rejected for complex dependencies)

### Architecture Decision: State Management
**Decision**: Use Redux Toolkit for global state + React Query for server state
**Rationale**:
- Redux Toolkit provides predictable state management for complex UI state
- React Query handles server state with caching, refetching, and synchronization
- Separation of concerns between client and server state
- Excellent TypeScript support and developer experience

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zustand (rejected for less structured approach)
- Context API only (rejected for performance issues with complex state)

### Architecture Decision: Styling Approach
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI component library
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- DaisyUI provides pre-built components consistent with design system
- Excellent responsive design capabilities
- Small bundle size and performance optimization
- Easy customization and theming

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI (rejected for heavy bundle size)
- Custom CSS (rejected for slower development)

### Architecture Decision: Routing Strategy
**Decision**: React Router v6 with nested routes and lazy loading
**Rationale**:
- Declarative routing approach improves maintainability
- Nested routes support complex application structure
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Excellent TypeScript integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Next.js routing (rejected for over-engineering for current needs)

### Architecture Decision: Data Fetching
**Decision**: Axios with interceptors + React Query
**Rationale**:
- Axios provides robust HTTP client with interceptors for auth
- React Query handles caching, refetching, and error states
- Automatic retry and background updates
- Excellent TypeScript support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fetch API (rejected for less feature-rich)
- SWR (rejected for less mature ecosystem)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Performance Risks
**Risk**: Large application bundle size due to comprehensive feature set
**Mitigation**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking

**Risk**: Performance degradation with large datasets
**Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling, pagination, and efficient data structures

### Complexity Risks
**Risk**: High complexity due to real-time features and multi-tenancy
**Mitigation**: Clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and incremental development

**Risk**: State management complexity with multiple projects and teams
**Mitigation**: Well-defined state architecture and normalized data structures

### Development Risks
**Risk**: Steep learning curve for team members
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, code reviews, and knowledge sharing

**Risk**: Integration challenges with backend API changes
**Mitigation**: TypeScript interfaces, API contracts, and integration tests

### User Experience Risks
**Risk**: Poor mobile experience due to complex desktop features
**Mitigation**: Mobile-first design approach and progressive enhancement

**Risk**: Accessibility issues with complex drag-and-drop interfaces
**Mitigation**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and accessibility testing
