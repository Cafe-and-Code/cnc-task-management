# Run Frontend Project

## Summary
Establish a working development environment for the CNC Task Management frontend application, including all necessary setup, configuration, and initial run procedures.

## Why
The frontend development environment was not properly configured and could not run in development mode. While the project structure and package.json existed, critical dependencies were missing, configuration issues prevented the development server from starting, and the build process was not validated. This blocked all frontend development work and prevented the team from building and testing the application.

## What Changes
This change establishes a complete frontend development environment by:
- Installing and configuring all required dependencies (65 packages including React, TypeScript, Vite, etc.)
- Resolving configuration issues (import errors, missing files, build configuration)
- Setting up development server with hot reload functionality
- Establishing production build process with proper optimization
- Configuring development tools (Prettier, Jest, ESLint)
- Creating comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
- Validating end-to-end functionality from development to production build

## Change Context
The frontend project exists with a complete package.json configuration including React, TypeScript, Vite, and various dependencies, but needs proper setup and validation to run successfully in development mode.

## Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive setup and run process for the frontend development environment, ensuring all dependencies are properly installed and configured for local development.

## Capabilities
- Frontend Development Environment Setup
- Dependency Management
- Development Server Configuration
- Build Process Validation

## Related Specs
- authentication (user authentication and session management)
- projects (project management functionality)
- tasks (task creation and management)
- sprints (sprint planning and execution)
- teams (team collaboration features)
- reports (reporting and analytics)

## Success Criteria
- Frontend application runs successfully in development mode
- All dependencies are properly installed
- Build process completes without errors
- Application loads in browser without critical errors
