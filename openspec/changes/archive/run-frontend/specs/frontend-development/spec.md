# Frontend Development Environment Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Frontend Development Setup
The system SHALL provide a complete development environment setup for the CNC Task Management frontend application.

#### Scenario: Initial Environment Setup
Given a developer has cloned the repository
When they run the setup process
Then all frontend dependencies shall be installed
And the development server shall start successfully
And the application shall be accessible in the browser

#### Scenario: Dependency Validation
Given the frontend project directory exists
When dependency installation is performed
Then all package.json dependencies shall be resolved
And no critical version conflicts shall exist
And development dependencies shall be available

### Requirement: Development Server Operation
The system SHALL provide a reliable development server with hot reload capabilities.

#### Scenario: Development Server Start
Given all dependencies are installed
When the development server is started
Then Vite shall start the development server
And the server shall listen on the configured port
And hot reload functionality shall be active
And console shall show successful startup message

#### Scenario: Hot Reload Functionality
Given the development server is running
When a source file is modified
Then the browser shall automatically update
And the changes shall be reflected without manual refresh
And component state shall be preserved when possible

### Requirement: Build Process Validation
The system SHALL provide a working build process for production deployment.

#### Scenario: TypeScript Compilation
Given the build process is initiated
When TypeScript compilation runs
Then all TypeScript files shall compile without errors
And type checking shall pass for all source files
And any type errors shall be reported with clear locations

#### Scenario: Production Build
Given TypeScript compilation succeeds
When the production build is executed
Then Vite shall create optimized build assets
And all dependencies shall be properly bundled
And the output shall be suitable for deployment

### Requirement: Development Tools Integration
The system SHALL provide integrated development tools for code quality and testing.

#### Scenario: Code Linting
Given the development environment is set up
When linting is executed
Then ESLint shall analyze all source files
And code style violations shall be reported
And auto-fix shall resolve common issues

#### Scenario: Testing Framework
Given the development environment is ready
When tests are executed
Then Jest shall run the test suite
And all test files shall be executed
And test results shall be reported with coverage information

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Application Loading
The frontend application SHALL load successfully in development mode with all core functionality accessible.

#### Scenario: Application Startup
Given the development server is running
When the application is accessed in a browser
Then the main application shell shall load
And authentication routes shall be available
And core navigation shall be functional
And no critical JavaScript errors shall occur

#### Scenario: Route Navigation
