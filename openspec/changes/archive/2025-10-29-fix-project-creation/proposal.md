# Fix Project Creation

## Summary
Fix critical issues preventing users from creating projects in the CNC Task Management application. The project creation functionality is currently broken due to import errors, missing React hook imports, and circular dependency issues with path aliases.

## Problems Identified

### 1. Import Errors in ProjectFormPage
- ProjectFormPage.tsx uses path aliases (`@hooks/redux`, `@store/slices`, `@types/index`) that cause circular dependency errors
- Missing imports for React hooks causing runtime failures
- Redux store integration failures preventing form submission

### 2. Broken Dependencies
- Services layer import inconsistencies between path aliases and relative imports
- Type definitions not properly imported from centralized types module
- Hook dependencies failing to resolve due to circular imports

### 3. Runtime Failures
- Form submission fails due to missing Redux actions
- User selection dropdowns empty due to failed service imports
- Navigation after project creation fails due to routing import issues

## Scope
This change focuses on fixing the core project creation functionality by:
1. Resolving import and dependency issues
2. Ensuring proper React hook imports
3. Fixing Redux integration
4. Validating API connectivity
5. Testing end-to-end project creation workflow

## Success Criteria
- Users can access the project creation form without errors
- Form validates all required fields correctly
- Project creation API calls succeed
- Users are redirected to project detail page after successful creation
- No runtime errors in browser console during project creation

## Dependencies
- Working Redux store configuration (completed)
- Resolved circular dependency issues (completed)
- Functional API client for backend communication
- Proper authentication state management

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Changes are limited to import fixes and existing functionality
- **No Breaking Changes**: Only fixing broken imports, not changing API contracts
- **Rollback Strategy**: Simple revert of import changes if issues arise
