# Project Creation Specification Fix

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project Creation Workflow
The system SHALL provide a functional project creation interface that resolves all import dependencies and allows users to successfully create new projects.

#### Scenario: Form Loading and Dependency Resolution
- **WHEN** an authorized user navigates to the project creation form
- **THEN** the system SHALL resolve all import dependencies without circular dependency errors
- **AND** load all required React hooks and components successfully
- **AND** display the project creation form without console errors
- **AND** load user data for Product Owner and Scrum Master selection

#### Scenario: Form Validation and Submission
- **WHEN** a user fills out the project creation form
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate all required fields (name, description, Product Owner, Scrum Master, start date)
- **AND** validate numerical inputs (velocity goal 1-100, sprint duration 1-30 days)
- **AND** ensure end date is after start date when provided
- **AND** enable form submission only when validation passes

#### Scenario: API Integration and Project Creation
- **WHEN** a user submits a valid project creation form
- **THEN** the system SHALL successfully call the projectService.createProject() API
- **AND** include authentication tokens in the request
- **AND** handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **AND** update the Redux store with the new project
- **AND** redirect to the project detail page or projects list

#### Scenario: Error Handling and Recovery
- **WHEN** project creation fails due to validation or API errors
- **THEN** the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user
- **AND** highlight form fields with validation errors
- **AND** preserve user input for correction
- **AND** allow retry without data loss

#### Scenario: Import Dependency Resolution
- **WHEN** the application loads project creation components
- **THEN** the system SHALL use relative imports instead of path aliases
- **AND** resolve React hook imports without circular dependencies
- **AND** successfully import Redux actions and store slices
- **AND** load all type definitions correctly

### Requirement: Component Import Consistency
The system SHALL ensure all components use consistent import patterns that avoid circular dependencies.

#### Scenario: Path Alias Migration
- **WHEN** components import from local modules
- **THEN** the system SHALL use relative paths instead of `@` prefixed aliases
- **AND** resolve imports for hooks, types, services, and store slices
- **AND** maintain type safety with TypeScript compilation

#### Scenario: React Hook Import Resolution
- **WHEN** components use React hooks (useEffect, useState, etc.)
- **THEN** the system SHALL properly import hooks from the 'react' package
- **AND** resolve hook dependencies without runtime errors
- **AND** enable proper hook execution in components

### Requirement: Redux Integration Validation
The system SHALL provide reliable Redux state management for project creation operations.

#### Scenario: State Update Synchronization
- **WHEN** projects are created or updated
- **THEN** the system SHALL update the Redux projects slice correctly
- **AND** refresh the projects list after successful creation
- **AND** maintain consistent state across the application

#### Scenario: Action Dispatch Reliability
- **WHEN** user actions trigger Redux operations
- **THEN** the system SHALL dispatch actions without import errors
- **AND** handle async thunks for API operations
- **AND** update loading and error states appropriately
