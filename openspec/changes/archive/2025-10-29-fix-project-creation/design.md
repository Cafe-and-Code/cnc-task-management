# Design Document: Fix Project Creation

## Current Architecture Issues

### 1. Circular Dependency Problems
The application uses path aliases (`@hooks`, `@types`, `@services`, `@store`) that create circular dependencies between:
- Store slices importing types from `@types`
- Components importing hooks from `@hooks`
- Services importing types from `@types`
- Types potentially depending on service definitions

### 2. Import Resolution Strategy
**Problem**: Path aliases cause runtime resolution issues in Vite
**Solution**: Convert to relative imports for all local dependencies

### 3. React Hook Import Pattern
**Problem**: Components using hooks without proper React imports
**Solution**: Ensure all hooks are properly imported from React

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Import Resolution
1. **Fix ProjectFormPage.tsx imports**
   - Convert `@hooks/redux` → `../hooks/redux`
   - Convert `@store/slices/projectsSlice` → `../store/slices/projectsSlice`
   - Convert `@types/index` → `../types/index`
   - Convert `@services/projectService` → `../services/projectService`

2. **Fix RoleBasedRoute.tsx imports**
   - Convert path aliases to relative imports
   - Ensure React imports are present

3. **Fix all components using path aliases**
   - Systematic replacement of `@` prefixed imports with relative paths
   - Validate import chains are circular-free

### Phase 2: Service Layer Integration
1. **Verify API Client Integration**
   - Test projectService.createProject() method
   - Validate API endpoint connectivity
   - Check authentication token inclusion

2. **Redux Integration Testing**
   - Verify createProject action dispatches correctly
   - Test fetchProjects action after project creation
   - Validate Redux state updates

### Phase 3: Form Validation Enhancement
1. **Client-Side Validation**
   - Ensure all required fields are validated
   - Test form error display and clearing
   - Validate form submission workflow

2. **User Selection Enhancement**
   - Test user loading and filtering
   - Validate Product Owner and Scrum Master selection
   - Ensure role-based user filtering works

## Technical Considerations

### Import Path Resolution
```typescript
// Before (broken)
import { useAppSelector } from '@hooks/redux';
import { fetchProjects } from '@store/slices/projectsSlice';
import { projectService } from '@services/projectService';

// After (fixed)
import { useAppSelector } from '../hooks/redux';
import { fetchProjects } from '../store/slices/projectsSlice';
import { projectService } from '../services/projectService';
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Enhanced error messages for form validation failures
- Network error handling for API calls
- User feedback for successful/failed project creation
- Graceful fallback for missing user data

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of user data for form dropdowns
- Debounced form validation
- Optimized re-renders during form interactions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Form validation logic
- API service integration
- Redux action creators and reducers

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end project creation workflow
- Navigation after project creation
- Error handling and recovery

### User Experience Testing
- Form accessibility and usability
- Loading states and error states
- Mobile responsiveness

## Success Metrics
- Zero console errors during project creation
- Successful API calls with proper error handling
- Form validation working correctly
- User able to complete entire project creation flow
- Proper redirection after project creation
